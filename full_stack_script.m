% Big debugger template that has everything from loading the files,
% decomposing every helper functions, and tons of buttons and keys for
% plotting and debugging.

% [TODO] Maybe turn this into a GUI? Can we do it in real time?

% 1. Load the trial
% - raw video and DLC data (.csv)


% 2. Pin and redact shuttle - this step is fine, will save output vid

% 3. Pre-tracking of pinned vid

% plot the frame by idx

% plot the pre-tracked points an the pre-mask by idx

% [TODO] slider in GUI to look through the frames. Leave a blank window at
% the bottom for experiments.

% [GUI] Workflow: 
% 1. load video and DLC
% 2. display fish head directions 
% 3. and suspicious tail activities
% 3. 
% acvitiinput the frame ranges -> calculate all the stuff
% needed -> allow sliding and clicking
